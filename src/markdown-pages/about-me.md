# It's-a-me Marlo!

I graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor's in Human-Computer Interaction. I 
am also a former research intern at the [The Design Lab](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/)
 on the hunt for a full-time User Researcher role.

I enjoy getting to know people and collecting sneakers. I like to
combine the two by walking in other people's shoes. I also enjoy
watching movies, yet I find that seeing the world through other peopleâ€™s
eyes tend to make for the best films.

In all seriousness, I believe in developing a deep understanding of
problems in order to bring forth the best solution.
