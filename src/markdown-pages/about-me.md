# It's-a-me Marlo!

I am a UC San Diego 2018 grad and former research intern at the The Design Lab 
on the hunt for a User Researcher role.

I enjoy getting to know people and collecting sneakers. I like to
combine the two by walking in other people's shoes. I also enjoy
watching movies, yet I find that seeing the world through other peopleâ€™s
eyes tend to make for the best films.

In all seriousness, I believe in developing a deep understanding of
problems in order to bring forth the right solution.
